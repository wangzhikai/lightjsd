Introduction
----
'lightjsd' is a light-weight Web server to study basic Web service functionality and to ease writing and testing Javascript programs. It uses Sun/Oracle com.sun.net.httpserver package. We wrap this server so it more convenient for us to add more tests, more easily to embed Javascripts in service contexts.
